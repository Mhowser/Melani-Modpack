## Java & JVM Flags

A very important step, here is a how-to:

Step 1: Download Java 16 from https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot
Step 2: Run the installer and complete it
Step 3: Now open the Minecraft launcher and edit your Fabric profile
Step 4: Select below "More options"
Step 5: See Java Executable and click on browse
Step 6: Now find the file javaw in the following directory: C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-16.0.0.36-hotspot\bin
Step 7: Select the file and click on save
Step 8: And you are done, should give a solid improvement in stability and performance

Please note some mods tend to break on the latest, all the mods from my modpack will work with it but if it doesn't work with any of your own added mods try Java 11 instead.
