## Mod list

The main attraction, behold my mighty list! 

Simply click on the name to directly download the latest version of the mod. Links are updated atleast once a week.

### Performance

- [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/suites/2359795839/artifacts/49961006) - One of the biggest mods to help out, optimizes general rendering.
- [Sodium Extra](https://github.com/FlashyReese/sodium-extra-fabric/suites/2363742178/artifacts/50058653) - A expansion for Sodium which adds a bunch more toggles.
- [Starlight](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Starlight/releases/download/1.0.0-RC1/starlight-forge-1.0.0-RC1-1.16.5.jar) - A rewrite of the lightning that is considerably faster.
- [Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/suites/2240511832/artifacts/46509597) - Smaller optimizations but anything is welcome.
-  ⚠️ [Lazydfu](https://ci.velocitypowered.com/job/lazydfu/12/artifact/build/libs/lazydfu-0.1.3-SNAPSHOT.jar) - If the DataFixerUpper finished his school this is the result. Loading times are heavily improved.
- [Krypton](https://ci.velocitypowered.com/job/krypton/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/libs/krypton-0.1.3-SNAPSHOT.jar) - Mainly for the server itself but can provide small use for the client aswell.
- FastChest
-  ⚠️ Entity Culling - Experimental but can help with big farms or lobbies full of players. Can't hurt to try right?
- Dynamic FPS - 
- NoFade

### Functionality

- AntiGhost
- Fabric API
- Modmenu
- Notenoughcrashes

## Java & JVM Flags

A very important step, here is a how-to:

- Step 1: Download Java 16 from https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot
- Step 2: Run the installer and complete it
- Step 3: Now open the Minecraft launcher and edit your Fabric profile
- Step 4: Select below "More options"
- Step 5: See Java Executable and click on browse
- Step 6: Now find the file javaw in the following directory: C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-16.0.0.36-hotspot\bin
- Step 7: Select the file and click on save
- Step 8: And you are done, should give a solid improvement in stability and performance

⚠️ *Please note some mods tend to break on the latest, all the mods from my modpack will work with it but if it doesn't work with any of your own added mods try Java 11 instead.*

## Optional steps

Still low on FPS? This corner is reserved for the perfectionist or the one on a low budget. (Coming Soon!! Don't forget!!)
