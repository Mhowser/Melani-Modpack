## Java & JVM Flags

A very important step, here is a how-to:

- Step 1: Download Java 16 from https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot
- Step 2: Run the installer and complete it
- Step 3: Now open the Minecraft launcher and edit your Fabric profile
- Step 4: Select below "More options"
- Step 5: See Java Executable and click on browse
- Step 6: Now find the file javaw in the following directory: C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-16.0.0.36-hotspot\bin
- Step 7: Select the file and click on save
- Step 8: And you are done, should give a solid improvement in stability and performance

⚠️ Please note some mods tend to break on the latest, all the mods from my modpack will work with it but if it doesn't work with any of your own added mods try Java 11 instead.
